<p class="text">
Does an increase in government spending cause a decrease in income inequality? Or is it the 
other way around? Does increasing health spending lead to children being more likely to 
stay in school? Does economic freedom lead to world happiness? What does it even mean for 
one indicator to "lead" to another?
</p>

<p class="sub-header header">Correlation</p>
<p class="text">
When we think of exploring index data, we often think of looking at correlations - does an 
increase in one indicator lead to an increase or decrease in another? Or is there no 
pattern in sight? 29 world development indices blow up into 406 pairwise comparisons - 
<b>explore some of the correlations yourself by hovering over edges.</b>
</p>

<p class="sub-header header">Noise</p>
<p class="text">
To get meaning from data, we need a way to filter it for what we want to see. <b>Click 
on an indicator node to see only the connections associated with it.</b> Most pairwise 
comparisons don't yield any significant patterns. <b>Use the slider to filter out weak 
correlations.</b> When you're done selecting a single node, <b>click outside of the node 
to unselect it.</b>
</p>

<p class="sub-header header">Causation</p>
<p class="text">
Correlation does not equal causation, but what if a network of correlations could highlight 
some potential causal relationships? Using the <a href="https://github.com/akelleh/causality">
IC* algorithm</a>, we can test if any two indicators are still dependent on each other even 
after factoring out all the surrounding indicators. When all the networks that fit the data 
can agree on a causal direction, we can draw an arrow, but if they cannot, we leave it as 
an undirected edge. <b>Browse the categories of inferred causal edges using the selection 
boxes.</b>
</p>

<p class="sub-header header">Meaning</p>
<p class="text">
How do we go from browsing data to finding meaning? We can use this spider's web of 
correlations as a launching point, but ultimately meaning will come from in-depth investigations 
that look at the people behind the numbers. If you're curious about inferring causal networks, 
there are great <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch25.pdf">
resources</a> online.
