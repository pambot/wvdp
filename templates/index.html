<p class="text">
Does an increase in government spending cause a decrease in income inequality? Or is it the 
other way around? Does increasing health spending lead to children being more likely to 
stay in school? Does economic freedom lead to world happiness? What does it even mean for 
one indicator to "lead" to another?
</p>

<p class="sub-header header">Correlation</p>
<p class="text">
When we think of exploring index data, we often think of looking at correlations - does an 
increase in something lead to an increase or decrease in something else? Or is there no 
pattern in sight? 29 world development indices blow up into 406 pairwise comparisons - 
<b>explore some of the correlations yourself by hovering over edges.</b>
</p>

<p class="sub-header header">Noise</p>
<p class="text">
Trying to pick out one particular edge in a graph of all possible connections can feel as 
frustrating as trying to decide which questions to ask of your data from the space of all 
possible questions. <b>Make things easier on yourself by filtering the absolute value of 
the correlation coefficients to get rid of the very weak correlations.</b>
</p>

<p class="sub-header header">Causation</p>
<p class="text">
Everyone who works with data has heard the mantra: correlation does not equal causation. 
But - without proving anything <i>per se</i> - what if you could infer causation out of a 
network of correlations? Two correlations don't necessarily mean anything, but three 
correlations start to give you a basis for comparisons. For example, consider three variables: 
cigarettes per day, incidence of lung cancer, and some kind of addictive personality quotient. 
All three are positively correlated with each other, but you notice that controlling for 
cigarettes per day actually makes the association between lung cancer and having an addictive 
personality just about random. This is means having an addictive personality will only 
lead to lung cancer if it leads you to smoking a lot, and from that, you can now draw a 
causal edge from smoking more cigarettes a day to getting lung cancer. <b>Running the world 
development indices through a causal discovery algorithm (IC) reveals a number of interesting, 
potentially causal, relationships.</b> <i>Caveat emptor</i>, though, this doesn't prove anything, 
it's just a way for networks of conditional probabilities to point your experiments in the 
right direction.
</p>

<p class="sub-header header">Meaning</p>
<p class="text">
So what does it mean for an increase in school life expectancy to lead to an increase in the 
human development index or for there to be no significant causal connections between the 
percent of women MPs and the other indices? Honestly, it's hard to say. But if you're going 
to ask questions on a limited bandwidth, the black edges aren't a bad place to start.
